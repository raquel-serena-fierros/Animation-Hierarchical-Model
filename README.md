# WebGL-Animation-Hierarchical-Model
The cat avatar is an animated hierarchical model programmed with WebGL which enables web content to use an API based on OpenGL ES 2.0 to perform 2D and 3D rendering in an HTML canvas.
The cat avatar moves around on a planar ground surface and is texture mapped with a cat fur JPEG photo, and the tower and ground are texture mapped with carpet JPEG photos.
